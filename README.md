# Project Name

This is an updated Mission to Mars Dashboard, built for longevity. It is a small html/css/js site wrapped in Jekyll for basic developer niceties, hacked together in an afternoon. 

It uses Bootstrap and jQueary for layouts and UI updates. Chart.js is used for charts, with all of these included within the project files to allow for offline use of built website.

There is no database. Missions are restricted to the browser used.
